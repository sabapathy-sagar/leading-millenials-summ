    <h1>A Practical Guide to Leading Millenials</h1>

  <p>
    Every generation has its own flavor, it's own way of seeing the world. Some of those unique characteristics
    and perspectives are positive, some are negative and some are nothing of particular note.
    The Millenial Generation has some unique personality-characteristics that seem to confound their employers.
    <br>
    <br>
    Many employers complain that their Millenial employees, for example, are poor communicators, lack the instinct 
    to be proactive, cannot handle critical feedback, are impatient, are unable to commit, and the big one: have a sense on entitlement.
    <br>

    <br>
    On the other hand, Millenials complain about their frustration with their employers.
    They express dismay that their bosses don't understand them or their lifestyles, give them enough feedback,
    make full use of their skills or show appreciation for their work.
    They would also like the companies they work for to have a greater sense of purpose and offer them a 
    work environment in which they can find fulfillment and feel like they are making an impact in the world.
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>Why is there such a huge gap between the Millenials and the prior gens?</b>
    <br>
    There appears to be three dominant factors that impacted, and continue to impact, Millenials most
    significantly as they grew up:
    <ul>
      <li>- over-parenting</li>
      <li>- ubiquitous technology</li>
      <li>- greater opportunities for instant gratification</li>
    </ul>
    The effects of all three are both exacerbated by and sometimes in conflict with the corporate 
    environments in which they now work.
    <br>
    (If you want to delve into these factors, Please refer to chapter 24 in the book 'Leader Eat Last')
    <br>
    <br>
    Based on how they grew up, the Millenials have many positive traits, that the previous gen (mostly) lacked:
    <ul>
      <li>- They are a remarkably accepting generation. In general, they seem to be more inclusive and more accepting 
        of people who are different from them.
      </li>
      <li>- They are loud about their desire to make an impact in the world through their work.</li>
      <li>- They are comfortable with change and are quicker to pivot than older gens.</li>
      <li>- They have the courage to embrace entrepreneurial paths more readily.</li>
      <li>- They seem to have a heightened desire that money and capitalism be used for good.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    Here are some practical, actionable steps on how to lead Millenials and bring out the best in them:

              More companies would benefit directly by taking advantage of the unique skills and perspectives Millenials bring to the table,
              thanks to their upbringing. 
             <br> 
              For example, Millenials grew up on social media. They have literally spent their entire lives curating their personal brands.
              They intuitively understand how branding works. Take advantage of it to build your company's brand.
              <br>
              <br>
              Millenials are comfortable with change and quicker to pivot than older gens. Older gens seem to prefer stability over uncertainity.
              If there is a project or opportunity that requires lots of quick turns, snap decisions, even risks - throw Millenials at it.
              Let your older employees support them with experience and know-how.
              <br>
              <br>
              Instead of complaining that Millenials are't showing up or aren't engaged, use them as a barometer of how you are doing
              as a leader or to gauge the kind of culture the company is building.
              If given something that is purposeful and inspires them to engage or stick around, Millenials will fully engage for a long, long time.

                Millenials in the workforce require leaders/mentors who are empathetic, understand the challenges that this generation faces,
                creates Circles of Safety and find ways to make the most of the many positive attributes and unique skills that they bring to the table.
                <br>
                (acknowledging that sometimes they may not have the courage to ask for it.)
                Proactively offer them mentorship programmes, where the mentor gets to know about their interestes & vision and
                offers support and guidance for them to grow acheive their vision.

                It's easy to talk about our achievements, but being frank about our failures helps Millenials understand
                the realities of the journey that is their life and career.
                Doing so also contributes directly to building a Circle of Safety, helping create a culture in which everyone feels more comfortable 
                to admit mistakes, fears and misgivings.

                  Build a culture which encourages 'embracing failures and learning from it'.
                  Millenials should be given more opportunities to fail. Oppurtunities to have a lot 
                  of responsibilities on smaller projects. And if they screw up we say, "good fail, now try it again."

                Many Millenials in the workplace say they want more feedback. In practise, what they seem to want is 
              more positive feedback, more affirmation when they do well.
                <br>
                Giving and recieving feedback are learnable and practicable skills. Getting better at giving feedback 
                is not simply about giving more feedback, it's learning how to give it positive and negative.
                Similarly, recieving feedback is not simply about demanding feedback, it's learning how to 
                recieve it, positive and negative, then knowing how to act on that feedback when it's offered.
